# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN_HERE}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You must replace {YOUR_TOKEN_HERE} with your personal access token.
